Basic installation
===================

If you are running PHP4, you must install the PHP_Compat Pear package:
'pear install PHP_Compat'.

Install php-postgresql.

Set up a PostgreSQL database and fill in the details for it in
config.php



Site configuration
===================

Create a directory mysite-templates and add that name to the front of
the $templatesdirs array in config.php. Also, for each subdirectory of
the the templates directory, create a like named one under
mysite-templates.

You can now override any templates in the templates directory, on a
per-object basis, by placing files in the mysite-templates directory
tree.

If you for example want to override the object view for the object
/boats/sailingboats/wooden and all sub-objects, you would create the
php-file mysite-templates/object/boats/sailingboats/wooden/default.php
(or edit.php if you want to override the editing form). You can also
override for a single object (without overriding for any sub-object)
by naming the file nonrecursive.default.php (or nonrecursive.edit.php)
instaed of just default.php.
